## ABOUT ME

Hi there 👋 I'm Ho Cong Thanh 

Embedded Systems student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), passionate about bridging hardware and software to build intelligent, efficient systems.
I'm currently developing my skills in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and low-level software development. My coursework and personal projects have given me hands-on experience with C/C++, real-time systems, and embedded architectures.
I'm actively seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute to real-world embedded systems projects while learning from experienced engineers. I'm particularly interested in roles that involve firmware development, system integration, and IoT applications.
Technical interests:

Microcontroller programming (ARM, AVR, ESP32)
Embedded C/C++ development
RTOS and real-time applications
Hardware-software co-design
IoT and sensor integration

Open to internships and collaborative projects. Let's connect!
